A console approach often use by video games such as "Dota 2" or "The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim" during debugging process to test some functionality. This approach can save a lot of time for developers, allowing you to code and test site functionality in a fraction of the time it would take otherwise.

Web application can also expose a console to speed up certain process. A console command indeed can be faster than a click of button. It is also open a possibility to live debug web application using console by developers.

This project is based on Carlos Saloio's course in Pluralsight that can be reuse in other web project.
